# Dynamic Digital Humans Quality Assessment Database 🚀🚀🚀

We are pleased to present our latest research paper proposing a large-scale database for dynamic digital human (DDH) quality assessment. Our database includes a total of 800 DDH videos, including manually degraded versions of ten movements of one male and one female with eight (six model-based and two motion-based) types of distortions. In addition, model-based distortion OBJ models and corresponding UV maps as well as original OBJ models and corresponding UV maps (used for motion-based distortion) are provided.

## Experiment Design

The 6 types of model-based distortions we used to degrade the reference DDH include position compression, UV compression, texture sub-sampling, texture compression, color noise, and geometry noise and the 2 types of motion-based distortions include skeleton binding error and motion range unnaturalness. We obtained a total of 800 distorted DDH.

A well-controlled subjective experiment was conducted to collect mean opinion scores (MOS) for the distorted DDH. We obtained the largest subject-rate quality assessment database for dynamic digital human(DDH-QA).
